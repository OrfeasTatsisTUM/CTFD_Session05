function [stencil] = stamp(i, j, X, Y, lamda, alpha, Tinf, boundary,TD)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%stencil calculates the linear equation for node (i, j)

%  Input:
%      i         node number in x direction
%      j         node number in y direction
%      X         x position of the nodes
%      Y         y position of the nodes
%      b         right-hand side value for node (i,j)
%      alpha     alpha
%      Tinf      Tinf for Robin BC
%      boundary  defines the boundary conditions
%      verbose   verbosity level
%
%  Output:
%      stencil   linear equation for node (i,j)
%      b         new right-hand side value for node (i,j)
